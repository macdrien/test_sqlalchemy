# Test SQLAlchemy

This repository is a test to use SQLAlchemy with a basic relation.  
The database represents a User who can be, or not, in teams.  
To experiment a bit more, I implemented a models folder which contains all models (User, Team, Member) and a __init__ which intanciate objects which are necessary for SQLAlchemy.
